finding my way - wont work for now


Process as I have been trying it:

Create mod

Create folder to run python script in, that folder has the same contence and file structure as the mod uploaded here.
It includes all the files that the python script needs and is designed to allow me to run the script and quickly pull the files I need to put in the mod.

Change "PrivilegeRaise" and PrivilageLower" to include the privilage you wish to add. See those files for the format I'm using to do that.

Run the script - if errors it's usually because you forgot to put a file in the place you are running the script and it can't find it.

If no errors: copy the full contence of the python folder into the mod and overwrite.

Take the names of privilages from PrivilegeUIList.txt and add them to common\estates\00_estates.txt - I am doing this for burgers at line 889
I have tried this for all of the versions of the burgher estate in the file, I'm unclear which is the correct one - none seem to work.

Take the new sprite code from gfx.txt and add it to the end of interface\countryestatesview.gfx - remember to put it inside the final } 
Ensure that "gfx\estates" contains .pngs that match the names just entered into the above. 

Load the game and see this: https://imgur.com/a/mxp5tto
note that noble estates privilages are all missing but one, they can be asigned though.
The burger estates have the shown odd star - and the new ones can be added.
